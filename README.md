verilog project

Hello everyone, I am Himanshu Gupta, a Final year student at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology. Here I am presenting you my project which is a 32-bit Arithmetic Logical Unit which can perform :-

Addition
Subtraction

The inputs to the ALU are 32-bit Single precision floating point numbers based on IEEE 754 convention.

Hope you like it.
